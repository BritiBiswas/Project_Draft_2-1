📄 Project Draft: Gene Mutation Pathway Optimizer using C++
🔷 Project Title:
Gene Mutation Pathway Optimizer using C++

🔍 Project Overview:
This project focuses on understanding how one gene can change (mutate) into another through small steps. Each gene is represented as a sequence of DNA letters (A, T, C, G). The goal is to find the shortest and most efficient mutation path from one gene to another using graph algorithms. It also uses trie data structures to store gene sequences efficiently for fast searching.

This project combines biology and computer science, and it can be useful for research such as studying how viruses or diseases evolve through gene mutations.

🧠 Reason for Choosing This Project:
As a Bioinformatics Engineering student, I wanted to work on a project that integrates biological concepts with algorithms. This project allows me to apply data structures and algorithms to solve a meaningful problem with potential research applications.

💻 Project Functionalities:

1.Load or input gene sequences from the user or a file.

2.Create a graph where each node represents a gene, and edges connect genes that differ by one mutation.

3.Use graph algorithms (BFS or Dijkstra) to find the shortest mutation path between two genes.

4.Store gene sequences using a trie for efficient search and prefix matching.

5.Suggest similar genes using edit distance if an exact match is not found.

6.Save mutation paths and results to a file for later reference.

7.Optionally, export the mutation graph in a format compatible with visualization tools like Graphviz.

🧩 Data Structures and Algorithms Used:

1.Graph (Adjacency List): To represent gene mutations.

2.Trie (Prefix Tree): For fast gene sequence lookup.

3.BFS / Dijkstra Algorithm: To find shortest mutation paths.

4.Edit Distance Algorithm: To find similar gene sequences.

5.Hash Map / Set: To keep track of visited genes and support fast access.

6.File Input/Output: To load gene data and save results.

🌱 Feature Summary:

1.Gene Input: Input or load gene sequences from user or file.

2.Trie Storage: Efficiently store and search gene sequences using a trie data structure.

3.Mutation Graph: Represent gene mutations as a graph connecting genes differing by one mutation.

4.Shortest Path Finder: Use graph algorithms like BFS or Dijkstra to find the shortest mutation path.

5.Similar Gene Suggestion: Suggest close matches when an exact gene is not found using edit distance.

6.File Save/Load: Save mutation paths and results to files for later use.

7.Graph Export (Optional): Export the mutation graph to a format compatible with visualization tools like Graphviz.

🔮 Future Scope:

1.Integrate real mutation data from public biological databases (e.g., NCBI).

2.Incorporate mutation probability scores to predict likely mutation paths.

3.Develop a graphical user interface for easier use by researchers.

4.Extend into a publishable research tool or software package.
